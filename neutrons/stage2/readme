1.) Building project

create next to directory 'stage2' the directory 'stage2-build'

in event2-build do 

:source /usr/local/geant4/geant4.10.01.p02-install/bin/geant4.sh
:cmake -DGeant4_DIR=/usr/local/geant4/geant4.10.02.p02-install/lib/Geant4-10.02/ ../stage2
:make

2.) Stage2 input

A list of particles to be read in and input into the simulation are
in an input file <input>_SlabNN.out.  To run simulation, in stage2-build do 

./run <input>_SlabNN.out > <output> 

this will run each particle listed in <input>_SlabNN.out 1000 times into 
the same model atmosphere/ground used in stage1 

<output> is a text file containing the output of the GEANT4 program 
execution and provides information on the geometry, physics packages, and 
number of input particles simulated. 

3.) Stage2 output

The stage2 program execution generations one output file named 
according to the convention GODOT_<input>_SlabNN.out 

The output file GODOT_<input>_SlabNN.out contains the particles that have
crossed the upper and lower boundary of a 1m tall volume on the ground 
that represents the physical height of the GODOT instrument.  The 
particles in this output file will be used as input particles into stage3
