1.) Building project

create next to directory 'stage3' the directory 'stage3-build'

in event3-build do 

:source /usr/local/geant4/geant4.10.01.p02-install/bin/geant4.sh
:cmake -DGeant4_DIR=/usr/local/geant4/geant4.10.02.p02-install/lib/Geant4-10.02/ ../stage3
:make

2.) Stage3 input

A list of particles to be read in and input into the simulation are
in an input file GODOT_<input>.out.  To run simulation, in stage2-build do 

./run GODOT_<input>.out input > <output> 

this will simulate a total of N_{3,in} particles (specified in the command 
/run/beamOn N_{3,in} in input) chosen from the particles listed in 
GODOT_<input>.out, which is a combination of all stage2 output files
(GODOT_<input>_SlabNN.out, NN = 0, 13)

<output> is a text file containing the output of the GEANT4 program 
execution and provides information on the geometry, physics packages, and 
number of input particles simulated. 

3.) Stage3 output

The stage3 program execution generates three output files named 
according to the convention LgPl_GODOT_<input>.out,  
SmPl_GODOT_<input>.out, LgNaI_GODOT_<input>.out, where <input> is the
name of the initial input file used in stage 1.

Each output file, <detector>_GODOT_<input>.out contains information on 
the energy deposited in the modeled detectore from the stage2 output 
particle interactions.
