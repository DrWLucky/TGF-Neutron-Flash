In general, follow installation guide at 
http://geant4.web.cern.ch/geant4/UserDocumentation/UsersGuides/InstallationGuide/html/ 

My final geant4 directory sturcture on SOL is 

   +- /usr/local/geant4 
       +- geant4.10.02.p02/
       +- geant4.10.02.p02-build/
       +- geant4.10.02.p02-install/

Hints for my Geant4 installation (CentOS 6.7): 

1.) Building Geant4

At step 2.1, set the following cmake flags 

	GEANT4_USE_OPENGL_X11=ON
	GEANT4_INSTALL_DATA=ON 
	GEANT4_USE_SYSTEM_EXPAT=OFF

i.e., in geat4.10.02.p02-build, do 

cmake -DGEANT4_USE_SYSTEM_EXPAT=OFF -DGEANT4_INSTALL_DATA=ON -DGEANT4_USE_OPENGL_X11=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../geant4.10.02.p02-install/ ../geant4.10.02.p02

3.) Building project

Create next to directory 'stage1' the directory 'stage1-build' 

in stage1-build do 

:source /usr/local/geant4/geant4.10.01.p02-install/bin/geant4.sh
:cmake -DGeant4_DIR=/usr/local/geant4/geant4.10.02.p02-install/lib/Geant4-10.02/ ../stage1
:make

4.) Stage1 input

TGF Simulation paramaeters are specified in an input file (e.g. 'input'). 
To run simulation, in stage1-build do 

./run <input> > <output>

this will create 13 output files names <input>_SlabNN.out where <input> 
is the input filename, and NN is the atmospheric slab number. 

<output> is a text file containing the output of the GEANT4 program 
execution and provides information on the geometry, physics packages, and 
number of input particles simulated. 

5.) Stage1 output 

The stage2 program execution generates several output files named
according to the convention <input>_SlabNN.out

the output files <input>_SlabNN.out contain information on the 
photoneutrons generated in the corresponding slab from the TGF 
specified in <input>.  The particles in these output files will be used 
as input particles into stage2.
